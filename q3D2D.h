	'getActions' method.  This method should return all actions
	(QAction objects). CloudCompare will automatically add them to an
	icon in the plugin toolbar and to an entry in the plugin menu
	(if your plugin returns several actions, CC will create a dedicated
	toolbar and sub-menu). 
	You are responsible to connect these actions to custom slots of your

	most of CC components (database, 3D views, console, etc.).
